# Diceware-simple-password-generator

Simple Python diceware password generator. 

Usage

You must pass a wordlist textfile as an argument.
The file must contain a word per line.
Anyway I have uploaded EFF's large wordlist (7776 words). You can find it in the repo.

Example

$spg.py eff_large_wordlist.txt
