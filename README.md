# Diceware-simple-password-generator

Simple Python diceware password generator. 

## Usage

You must pass a wordlist textfile as an argument.
The file must contain a word per line.
Anyway I have uploaded [EFF's large wordlist](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt) (7776 words). You can find it in the repo.

## Example

`$spg.py eff_large_wordlist.txt`
